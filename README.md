# Project Title

## Aim

This project aims to design an application that allows students to pre-book autos and cabs and join other groups traveling to the same place simultaneously.

## Scope

This projectâ€™s scope is to design, develop, and implement Ryder using MVVM architecture, Firebase authentication, and Firestore database. The application will be made in Java on Android Studio.

## Extra Features

- Jetpack Navigation
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore Database
- Crash analytics
- UPI

### Safe Args

Navigation allows you to attach data to a navigation operation by defining arguments for a destination. For example, a user profile destination might take a user ID argument to determine which user to display.

## GPay UPI API Integration

Ryder offers seamless and secure transactions through UPI payments using Google Pay (GPay) API. Here are some key features:

- Developed a campus-exclusive cab booking app with integrated UPI payments via GPay API for seamless transactions.
- Followed Material Design principles to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
- Implemented Firebase-powered chat functionality to connect drivers and riders, enhancing real-time communication and ride coordination.
- Leveraged GPay API for UPI payments, Firebase for chat functionality, and followed Material Design guidelines in the development of the campus cab booking app.
